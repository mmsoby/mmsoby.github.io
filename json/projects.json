A significant achievement of this project was fulfilling the client's unique requirement to operate and maintain the website at zero cost. This was accomplished by strategically leveraging cost-effective platforms and open-source solutions. </p><p> The project, completed between September 2023 and May 2023, showcases our ability to meet complex client needs effectively. I would show a link to the application but unfortunately the client took the site down while preparing their business for launch.",

I have created videos on a variety of topics, including my projects, xcode customization, crypto trading bots, java/python installations, and environment configuration. <p></p> To my surprise my most popular video, with 21k views, is about properly installing Java and JavaFX on a M1 mac. The reason I made it in the first place was that at the time the existing documentation was terrible, and it seems many other people shared that frustration. <p></p> I am not necessarily trying to grow my channel as of now, I just enjoy documenting my progress and sharing what I learned. Teaching others has been a great way for me to cement my understanding in a subject. Another benefit I received from making these videos is learning how to script, record, and edit videos.",

I looked online for a list of the products I would need to buy to get my apartment set up properly, but couldn't find anything that suited my needs. I also needed to make sure everything I bought would be a good investment and be a long lasting product. After filling out the spreadsheet I wanted to share it with others. I also decided to make it into an open-source repository so that people can contribute. For many of the products I give a short review and why I chose it. I also give a detailed list of my work from home setup.",
