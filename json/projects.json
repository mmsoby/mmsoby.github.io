A significant achievement of this project was fulfilling the client's unique requirement to operate and maintain the website at zero cost. This was accomplished by strategically leveraging cost-effective platforms and open-source solutions. </p><p> The project, completed between September 2023 and May 2023, showcases our ability to meet complex client needs effectively. I would show a link to the application but unfortunately the client took the site down while preparing their business for launch.",
