        <p>
            Welcome! I'm Mustafa Soby, a dedicated computer science master's student at The University of Texas at
            Austin, slated to graduate in December 2026. My journey began at the University of Michigan - Dearborn,
            where I completed my bachelor's degree with a strong GPA of 3.97. My technical prowess spans a wide range of
            languages, tools, and frameworks, including TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, SQL, HTML/CSS, and
            proficiency in React, Firebase, Git, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Professionally, I have honed my skills through internships at GE Aviation, Technical Computer Services, and
            Noor Diagnostic Lab, where I tackled projects like modularizing Siemens TeamCenter templates, developing
            automation software, and improving lab workflows. Additionally, I played a key role in university projects,
            such as leading backend administration and collaborating on an e-commerce website design.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about leveraging my skills in software engineering roles, eager to bring my combination of
            academic knowledge and practical experience to innovative projects and challenges.
