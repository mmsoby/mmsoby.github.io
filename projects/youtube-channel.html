            I created a YouTube channel to share what I have learned and showcase my projects. I have created videos on a variety of topics, including my projects, xcode customization, crypto trading bots, java/python installations, and environment configuration. <p></p> To my surprise my most popular video, with 21k views, is about properly installing Java and JavaFX on a M1 mac. The reason I made it in the first place was that at the time the existing documentation was terrible, and it seems many other people shared that frustration. <p></p> I am not necessarily trying to grow my channel as of now, I just enjoy documenting my progress and sharing what I learned. Teaching others has been a great way for me to cement my understanding in a subject. Another benefit I received from making these videos is learning how to script, record, and edit videos.
